**Difference between returns and appeasements**     
**Returns**: When you take something back to the store because you don't like it or it's broken, and you get your money back or exchange it for something else.     
**Appeasements**: When the store does something extra to make you happy because you had a problem with their product or service, without necessarily needing you to bring back what you bought.
